Main.py file is now Main.pyw
army1.py has been removed since it was 100% useless
Started work on translation
Started making configs better
Made Bastion map better
Armies below 10% health attack even more rare!
Added:
- Button that enables AI, no more config for that!
- Button that turns on city ownership overlay!
  - The 'o' key still works fine,
  - This is first non-menu button added since 17 December 2024 (before project was on Github)
Fixed:
- File should now run without VScode
- Fixed boats moving and leaving units on water
- New buttons being created each time "start" button was clicked,
- Fixed issue with button original picture being a rect, not surface.
