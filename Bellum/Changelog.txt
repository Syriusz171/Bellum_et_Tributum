Added:
- Searock tile (i have no better name for it):
  - It is a water tile with movement cost of 1.5,
  - There is small chance (1/12) it will appear on water tile next to the land,
  - The chance increases for each adjacent mountain,
  - Cannot appear when is surrounded with 4 mountains,
- Island tile (Work in progress):
  - Cannot be found (yet),
  - Same as empty tile but with hopefully better appearance!
  - Villages found on it get +1 base defence strength.
Changed:
- Ships' movement points increased from 3.5 to 4.
- Pre-made maps now show thieir name instead of 'manual'.
Fixed:
- Fixed issue when armies could not disembark on not-empty tiles (forests,ore deposits etc)
