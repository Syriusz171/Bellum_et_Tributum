# Bellum et Tributum
The world's worst turn-based strategy game! The name is temporary and it will be changed!  
## **WARNING**  
The game is <ins>**not**</ins> completed!  
Requires Python and Pygame to be installed on your computer!
### Game modes:  
- One computer multiplayer (hot seat)
  - Play on one computer with your friend (or someone else)!
- More gamemodes (proper singleplayer, maybe even campaign) will be avalitable one day  
  provided I do not run out of patiance [SPOILER: I will].
  
The game is about founding villages and conscripting armies and fighting using them!  
### Known issues  
- Multi-army movement (and yes, it DOES exist) works badly when one army moves onto a tile where was another moving army
### Plans (or rather dreams of mine):
- Mode to fight bots (badly implemented!)
- More resourses like army-specific supplies, salt, stone etc (that has to be done, right? Right?)
- Local resourses (that is resourses being stored in villages) and resourse trasport system (i guess it is a dream)
- Unit upkeep (armies would need to be moved with supplies) (dream)
- More under projects tab.
### Translations
I **WILL NOT** translate this game to other languages
because I want translations to be accurate (that is not made using translate.google.com nor AI)!    
The only exception is Polish, since I speak Polish.  
However if YOU want to translate it to your language, you are welcome!
